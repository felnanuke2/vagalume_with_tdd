# Flutter + TDD + Vagalume APi

This project uses TDD and tests together with the https://www.vagalume.com.br/ api to search Vagalume Rankings.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

To test just create an account on Vagalume and get your api key,
then 
- create a file in lib/constants named api_key.dart.
- within this file create a final variable named "VAGALUME_API_KEY" and it will give you the value of your api_key obtained from the Vagalume website.
- then just run a flutter run and that should do it.
- You can also run flutter test to run the tests.
